                    <p class="lead mb-5">A Full-Stack Web Developer that is always looking to solve a problems in new and innovative/creative ways. Coding is something enjoyable because there is always something changing or new to learn. Meaning, skills and personal abilities are in constant need for polishing and improvement.
                        When finding myself in a challenging situation I find that slowing things down and assessing the situation from different perspectives will typically yeild better results, rather than non-stop or sporadic troubleshooting.
                        Agile enviornments are a place that I'm comfortable in as I have had a lot of experience and time spent in them. In my free time, currently I am training for a marathon, and enjoy time at home with the family. </p>

                            <p>Directly handled client experience and oversaw daily operations of the company. - worked one on one with big clients to ensure the best experience possible. Developed procedures across all aspects of the company, including P and L sheets. - created everything from our scheduling procedures to our receipt management system, to the maintenance schedule, to the check in/check out procedure to minimize missed damage/ over mileage (these were our biggest losses as a company) Expense tracking, and employee payments. Taught and lead team to use newly implemented procedures/processes - helped decide new hires and was given the task to onboard. Worked with different hotel chains to win deals for supplying hotel chauffeur vehicles, including A/C hotel and the Leveque Marriot’s Autograph Collection hotel downtown. - This consisted of meeting with and agreeing on certain special rates given promotionally for the hotels to help give a steadier stream of revenue for the company. Managed coordination for delivery of vehicles all over the Midwest and East Coast – Making sure that the delivery team was clear with the schedule, we added a color-coded system to make it easier for them to know where and when they were needed somewhere. Influenced and made procurement decisions for vehicles in the fleet – meetings to discuss the growth of the company/fleet were daily conversations, we used different market research from apps like Turo and other rental car companies to decide the best additions or changes that were made. Fleet value increased by 430% during my time at the company. - the fleet was approximately $400,000.00 in value when I arrived and when I left, the fleet was approximately $1,750,000.00 in vehicle value. -This was due to some clever financial movements as well as the shift of the exotic car market.</p>

                            <p>Worked an underdeveloped territory to increase our market share by 15% from previous year – being intentional with scheduling my time in certain areas of the territory. If I was visiting a customer on a certain day, I would call around their area to schedule appointments with prospects and current customers to aid with any current needs Within 6 months lead the Cincinnati team and was 5th in the nation of the 66 dealers in sales. Went through different Toyota training, including CSSR Camp 1, Rain Group (value selling), and CRM training. - Completed Toyota Customer Service Representative Training Developed skills for B2B communication and sales. Supplied custom tailored solutions for customer issues – ex. One customer had an extremely hot environment where their forklift operator had to be very precise. (Many times, they had dropped the product damaging it and making it unusable) They needed a camera on the forks to give the operator a better view of where they were putting the load. The heat would melt just about any cord near the forks, so took the customer’s concern and researched some options. I found a company that made heat rated wireless cameras and worked with them to create a solution for my customer. They are still using that solution today!</p>

I love enjoying, learning,and experiencing different aspects of the places I go. For example the different cultures, cuisines, arcitectures, and languages just to name a few. In the winter time I really enjoy snowboarding. During summer and fall I like to go camping, hiking, and boating.</p>
                    <p class="interests">For a more low key weekend indoors, I enjoy watching different anime series. Listening and exploring new music, and while doing that reading and catching up on new happenings in the world of tech, and currently I am getting back into learning more spanish.</p>
